We upload template files instead of all original files to avoid storing a large number of similar files.
For example, you can revise variables in the block of "Setting Experiments" to change parameters, such as optimizer, learning rate, batch size, number of hidden neurons, etc.
Functions were stored in the subfolder "udvFunctions", which are necessary to run the templates.
Datasets are public available, and you can find the reference in our paper.

Core dependencies: Python version 3.9.5 and PyTorch version 2.0.1.
The experiments were performed using a reproducible setup, but different environments (hardware or software) may result in slight differences from the results reported in the paper.
